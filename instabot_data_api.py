########################################## Data API ##########################################

###### 1. Data API definition and objectives :
# The data produced by the bot is essential for diverse consumers. These consumers are of 2 types :
# - analysts : the human beings that will query the data to perform any kind of analysis and produce insights
# - services : any service built on top of the data, such as ML models, dashboard, email sending...
# The data API is here to ensure perfect clarity to the consumers over what the data contains, and guarantees
# the quality of that data by controlling the modification that data producers (here the bot) can bring to 
# that data.
# Concretely, within the API are defined the schema and documentation for each table.
# The schema of a table being the list of column names, types, nullability, possibly acceped values and description.
# On their side, data producers (here the bot python code) can call the API whenever they want to get or alter the 
# data in any way. When a call is about a modification, the API check that it is conform to the registered schema
# of the concerned table.

###### 2. How to use it :
### - Register a new table definition :
# In the class registeredTableDefinitions, create a new class variable. The name of the variable is the 
# name of the table definition. The value of the variable has to be a dictionary with the 
# following structure : {"description" : "Table description", "schema":{"col_1_name":"description",...}}
# There can be several tables (CSVs) following a given table definition : one per user.
# If a table follows the table definition X and stores the data for user joebiden, its name will be 
# X_joebiden, and it will be stored into the CSV file "X_joebiden.csv".
# A table cannot be managed by the API if it doesn't follow a registered table definition.
### - Call the API
# Once a table definition has been registered, there can be as many tables (CSVs) following that table definition
# as users. 
# You can : 
# - load these tables as pandas dataframe : dataAPI().get(table_definition_name,user)
# - add a record to any table : dataAPI().get(table_definition_name",user,record)
# - store a new version of the table : dataAPI().store(table_definition_name",user,new_table)
# You can see that for each call to the API you have to specify an existing table_definition_name
# (basically a registered table definition)

class registeredTableDefinitions:
    
    '''
    In that class we have all the table definitions, stored as class variables.
    The name of the class variable is the name of the table definition.
    A table definitions is a table description, a list of column names and a name for each column .
    It is stored under the form of the dict with the following structure :
        {"description" : "Table description", "schema":{"col_1_name":"description",...}}
